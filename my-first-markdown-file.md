# Hello Markdown!

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic synatx
* Write you doc
* Done!

Now ou can be a Wiz at this language and code up stuff like 'console.writeline(Hllow Markdown!");'

Can't remember the language? No problem! just visit one of these resources:
